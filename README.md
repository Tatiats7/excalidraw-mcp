# Excalidraw MCP App Server with Narration!

MCP server that streams hand-drawn Excalidraw diagrams with smooth viewport camera control and interactive fullscreen editing.

![Demo](docs/demo.gif)

## Install

Works with any client that supports [MCP Apps](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/extensions/apps) — Claude, ChatGPT, VS Code, Goose, and others. If something doesn't work, please [open an issue](https://github.com/antonpk1/excalidraw-mcp-app/issues).

### Remote (recommended)

### `https://excalidraw-mcp-app.vercel.app/mcp`

Add as a remote MCP server in your client. For example, in [claude.ai](https://claude.ai): **Settings** → **Connectors** → **Add custom connector** → paste the URL above.

### Local

**Option A: Download Extension**

1. Download `excalidraw-mcp-app.mcpb` from [Releases](https://github.com/antonpk1/excalidraw-mcp-app/releases)
2. Double-click to install in Claude Desktop

**Option B: Build from Source**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/antonpk1/excalidraw-mcp-app.git
cd excalidraw-mcp-app
pnpm install && pnpm run build
```

Add to `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "excalidraw": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/excalidraw-mcp-app/dist/index.js", "--stdio"]
    }
  }
}
```

Restart Claude Desktop.

## Usage

Example prompts:
- "Draw a cute cat using excalidraw"
- "Draw an architecture diagram showing a user connecting to an API server which talks to a database"

## Voice Narration

Diagrams can be narrated with text-to-speech audio using [ElevenLabs](https://elevenlabs.io/). As the diagram streams in, voice narration plays alongside the drawing animations.

To enable voice narration, set the `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` environment variable:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "excalidraw": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/excalidraw-mcp-app/dist/index.js", "--stdio"],
      "env": {
        "ELEVENLABS_API_KEY": "your-api-key-here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Optionally, set `ELEVENLABS_VOICE_ID` to use a specific voice (e.g. your own cloned voice):

```json
"env": {
  "ELEVENLABS_API_KEY": "your-api-key-here",
  "ELEVENLABS_VOICE_ID": "your-voice-id-here"
}
```

If no voice ID is provided, the default ElevenLabs voice is used.

**Note:** Voice narration is not automatic — you need to explicitly ask the model to narrate (e.g. "draw a diagram explaining photosynthesis and speak through it").

**Voice Sync:** Drawing pauses at each voice element until audio finishes (max 5s wait). Keep each voice under ~8 words for perfect sync between narration and visuals.

## What are MCP Apps and how can I build one?

Text responses can only go so far. Sometimes users need to interact with data, not just read about it. [MCP Apps](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/ext-apps/) is an official Model Context Protocol extension that lets servers return interactive HTML interfaces (data visualizations, forms, dashboards) that render directly in the chat.
